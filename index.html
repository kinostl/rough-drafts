        <h2>What is Collaborative Storytelling?</h2>
        <p>Collaborative Storytelling is the act of creating stories with a group of likeminded individuals. You work
            together coming up with characters, locations, and history then combine them all together into finalized
            stories.</p>
        <h3>How is this different from Roleplaying?</h3>
        <p>You don't own the assets you create, your writing group does. In the same way, the writing group owns the
            story it creates. Everyone is an author to the story, and you don't always have the final say on a character
            you brought to the table.</p>

        <h2>What does Rough Drafts provide?</h2>
        <h3>Writer's Groups</h3>
        <p>You can create a circle of friends who can collaborate on stories. These circles are the only ones who can
            see anything owned by the circle, until its ready for public view.</p>
        <h3>"Story Bible" Knowledge Bases</h3>
        <p>Rough Drafts provides you the tools to create a "Story Bible". A knowledge base that tracks the various
            characters in a story, the key locations within it, and major historical events that directly influence the
            ongoing story. Like any wiki, these knowledge bases provide a per-page history that can be rewound.</p>
        <h3>Discussions</h3>
        <p>A chatroom only accessible by the writers group. These are highly integrated to the Knowledge base, and
            provide tools to quickly preview elements being mentioned without needing to open a new page.</p>
        <h3>Drafts</h3>
        <p>Using a popcorn technique, members of the writers group take turns writing sections of the story and passing
            control to the next member.</p>
        <h3>Diaries</h3>
        <p>Individual members have a feed of notes that are private or public as they wish, useful for writing down
            thoughts, or sharing them with others. This is federated, and compatible with the federated network such as
            Mastodon.</p>
        <h3>Stories</h3>
        <p>Stories can be published right here on Rough Drafts, in a finalized form viewable by anyone you desire.
            Organized, comfortable to read, and easy to discover.</p>
